Because we like to make things, and we like to make an impact, iconic courses like 2.009 emphasize designing, inventing, collaborating, and translating students\' expertise to reach the world. Through signature experiential learning programs like UROP, UPOP, MISTI, PKG, IAP, D-Lab, NEET, and Sandbox, students can pursue virtually infinite co-curricular and extracurricular projects — here at MIT, throughout the Greater Boston innovation hub, and around the world. Honeycombed with legendary laboratories and dozens of makerspaces, a wind tunnel, a research nuclear reactor, and a glass lab, our campus of idiosyncratically numbered buildings adds up to a prime spot to make the most of your potential.',
